# dotfiles 
My configuration for dotfiles. I use a combination of both the `vim` and `lua` scripting languages to configure my `neovim` editor.

## Getting Started
To ensure a seamless experience moving forward, please go through each of the subsections in a chronological manner.

### Prerequisites
I used the `vim-plug` plugin manager to manage my vim plugins. To install the `vim-plug` plugin manager, do the following:

##### Unix
```sh
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

##### Windows
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim |`
    ni $HOME/vimfiles/autoload/plug.vim -Force
```

If the commands do not work, go to <https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug> for extra guidance. Otherwise, you need to install `Node` on your system. You can find the download links on the [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download) website, from there, download any of the listed `stable` versions.
